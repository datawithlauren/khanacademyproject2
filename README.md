# SQL Project: Data Dig
## Khanacademy / More advanced SQL queries
### Summary
Using an example dataset provided, [Marvel Characters](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/585364b62390ea720858), I have then applied advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data. 

*The following questions are then answered to apply SQL learnings:*
1. Order the Marvel characters by ascending popularity.
2. Calculate the average popularity of Marvel characters and categroize popularity <30 as 'more_than_avg_popularity'.
3. Who is the tallest Marvel character?
4. Caluculate the BMI of the Marvel characters and classify their BMI. When BMI  is less than 18.5, output as 'underweight', 'normal' for BMI between 18.5 and 24.9, 'overweight' for BMI between 25.0-29.9 and 'obese' for otherwise. 
5. How many Marvel characters are in each category of alignment?
6. Which Marvel characters are good and from the USA?
7. Which Marvel characters are shorter than average height and lighter than average weight?
8. How many male and female Marvel characters are in this list?
9. Good vs. Bad - Who will win in a battle?
10. A goal of this table is to show the 'Potential' of each Marvel character. When popularity <10, output 'Top Tier', 'Mid Tier' for popularity less or equal to 20 and intelligence more or equal to 6, 'Low Tier' for popularity less than 50 and intelligence less or equal to 6, and 'Bottom Tier' for otherwise.
