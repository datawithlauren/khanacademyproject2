# SQL Project: Data Dig
## Khanacademy / More advanced SQL queries
### Summary
Using an example dataset provided, [Marvel Characters](https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/585364b62390ea720858), I have then applied advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data. 

*The following questions are then answered to apply SQL learnings:*
1. Order the Marvel characters by ascending popularity.
2. Calculate the average popularity of Marvel characters and categroize popularity <30 as 'more_than_avg_popularity'.
3. Who is the tallest Marvel character?
4. Which Marvel characters are good and from the USA?
5. Which Marvel characters are shorter than average height and  lighter than average weight?
6. Good vs. Bad - Who will win in a battle?
7. A goal of this 'Potential' table is to show how the potential of each Marvel character. When popularity <10, output 'Top Tier', 'Mid Tier' for popularity less or equal to 20 and intelligence more or equal to 6, 'Low Tier' for popularity less than 50 and intelligence less or equal to 6, and 'Bottom Tier' for otherwise.
